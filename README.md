# Email_Spam_detection

**Aim : The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model for the classification of spam and ham emails. Also to build a web application that effectively predict whether an email is spam or not.**

**Introduction**

In today's digital age, email has become one of the primary modes of communication for individuals and businesses alike. However, alongside legitimate communication, email users often receive a significant amount of unwanted or unsolicited emails, commonly known as "spam." Spam emails can range from advertising and marketing messages to phishing attempts and malicious content, posing a threat to users' privacy and security.

By analyzing the textual content, subject lines, sender information, and other relevant features of email messages, the model will learn to accurately differentiate between spam and legitimate emails. The ultimate goal is to create a reliable and efficient system that can automatically filter out spam emails, thereby improving users' email experience and enhancing their online security.


**Key Objectives:**

- Collect and preprocess a dataset of labeled emails, containing examples of both spam and ham messages.
- Extract relevant features from the email data, such as text content, subject lines, sender information, and more.
- Build and train a machine learning model using supervised learning techniques, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or deep learning models.
- Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision etc.
- Fine-tune the model parameters and explore different feature engineering techniques to improve classification performance.
- Deploy the trained model as a practical solution for email classification, allowing users to automatically filter spam emails in real-time.
